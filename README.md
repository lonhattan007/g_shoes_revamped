# g_shoes_revamped

Revamped version of the [Gshoes](https://github.com/lonhattan007/gshoes) shopping app for sneaker heads.
Simple shopping cart demonstration.

This simple project can be a good starting point for learning new front-end technologies, or for a quick prototype.
This branch is built with Vue.js.
